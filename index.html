                    The Battle of Stalingrad is considered a turning point in WWII, as it marked the beginning of the end for Nazi Germany. The defeat at Stalingrad was a major blow to the morale of the German troops and marked the first time that they had been forced to retreat on the Eastern Front.

                    The battle was also significant because it was fought entirely in an urban setting, with both sides fighting for control of every building, street, and alleyway. The fighting was brutal and often hand-to-hand, with both sides sustaining heavy losses.
